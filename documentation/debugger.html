   <h2>Notes and Cautions:</h2>
   <p>
    The following emulation modules have at least basic debugger functionality implemented
    <ul>
     <li>md</li>
     <li>nes</li>
     <li>pce</li>
     <li>pcfx</li>
     <li>psx</li>
     <li>ss</li>
     <li>vb</li>
     <li>wswan</li>
    </ul>
   </p>

   <p>
    <u><b>Save States, Power/Reset</b></u>:  Utilizing save states and power toggling/resetting in step mode may lead to
      significant malfunctions or glitches in the following emulation modules:
	<ul>
	 <li>md</li>
	 <li>nes</li>
	 <li>psx</li>
	 <li>ss</li>
	 <li>vb</li>
	 <li>wswan</li>
	</ul>
      Additionally, these aforementioned acts may cause minor non-fatal glitches in the sound output with all modules with debugger functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u><b>Video Updates</b></u>: The last valid(non-skipped) video frame is drawn while in step mode.  Older versions of Mednafen would
   attempt to draw the current, incomplete frame as emulation progressed, but this was rather buggy because the emulation code was not
   designed with it in mind.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u><b>Read Breakpoints</b></u>: Opcode, operand, and prefix(in WonderSwan case) fetches will trigger read breakpoints in the NES, PC Engine, and WonderSwan
    debuggers.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u><b>PC Breakpoints</b></u>: PC breakpoints are evaluated only for the state of PC at the start of the instruction(or start of prefixes for an instruction
   in the case of V30MZ); IE, a PC breakpoint set on the address of an operand byte(6502, HuC6280, V30MZ) or the second
   16-bits of a 32-bit instruction(V810) will not be triggered when the instruction is executed.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u><b>Branch History</b></u>: When the CPU debugger view is not active, the branch history will only be updated reliably when at least one breakpoint
   is active/installed.

  <h2>Memory Poking</h2>
  </p>
  <p>High-level poking will attempt to write the desired value to the underlying storage(ROM or RAM).  Normal(low-level) poking
  will go through the same write handlers as the virtual CPU operates through.  Note that high-level poking is not implemented
  for all systems.
  </p>
  <p>The format for the string to enter when poking memory(highlevel or lowlevel), is "[*]address value [size]", with values
  in brackets being optional.  Prefixing the address with a "*" will cause the address to be treated as a physical address,
  which is currently only meaningful on systems that have paging registers internal to the CPU, such as the PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16.
  </p>
  <h2>Read and Write Breakpoints</h2>
  <p>
  You may enter either a single address to break on, or a range.  Read and write breakpoints operate on logical addresses, unless you prefix the address with a "*", or the first
  address in the case of a range.<br><big><b>Exception:</b></big>  WonderSwan read/write breakpoints only operate on 20-bit physical addresses for
  the time being.  Furthermore, only the lower 8 bits of WonderSwan I/O breakpoints are considered.
  </p>
  <p>
  Multiple entries should be separated by one space character.  Examples:</p>
  <pre>
   2000-2007 4014 4015
   0000 1800 2300-23ff
   *1fe000
  </pre>
  You may also use "segment:offset" form with absolute addresses with PC Engine emulation, such as:
  <pre>
   *ff:0000-ff:03ff
  </pre>
  ...which will cause a break on any writes to the VDC, including the ST0, ST1, ST2 instructions.  Note that the offset is internally ANDed with 0x1FFF, so 0x2000 and 0x0000 would be equivalent offsets.
  <p>
  <b>WonderSwan notes:</b><br>
  Segment(16-bit):offset(16-bit) form can also be used with the WonderSwan debugger, but you still need to prefix it with a "*", even though logical address
  breakpoints aren't supported with WonderSwan emulation currently.  Also, the segment:offset pair is internally translated to a 20-bit address,
  and because segments overlap, you can get breakpoints to occur on writes with other segments than the one you specified.
  </p>
  <h3>Aux Read and Write Breakpoints</h3>
  <p>
  Aux r/w breakpoints operate on secondary storage reads and writes.
